There will be a player class that has a data element called score.
There will have to be an abstract weapon class where all weapon option classes would extend from.
The abstract weapon class would have losing and winning arraylists for the subclasses that would lose or win against the current subclass.

Player would need a weapon data element called option.

To ensure the players participate in rounds, in a while loop each player will be asked to pick their option until one wins.
When the creator adds a new weapon option, we will have a methods that loops through all arraylists and update all subclasses.
