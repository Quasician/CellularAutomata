## Team Roles and Responsibilities

 * Thomas Chemmanoor": Generalist. Helped create and debug basic implementation simulations, revamped xml writing (writing each cell into a file to load from)
  and xml parsing (file that created sims from files). I created the Visualizer class as well as the autoscaling cell feature for the window. 
  I created common methods used across all simulations to keep track of the number of each sim's states so
  that we could supply this info to the graph. Worked on exception handling towards the end of the project with Vineet.

 * Rodrigo Araujo

 * Vineet Alaparthi: Worked on configuration and visualization, on tasks such as XML parsing and creating, as well as designing and creating the UI for the project and bringing all the components together.


## Design goals

#### What Features are Easy to Add
One of the features that is easy to add are new simulations. This is because there is an abstract simulation class, that makes it relatively  easy to create and add new simulation. While the rules of the simulation still need to be implemented (this is not something that can be abstracted as it is a unique feature of each simulation) the abstraction allows for the other parts of the simulation to be implemented easier than if it was not there. Another feature that we designed to be easy to implement was the graph boundaries (finite, toroidal). Our design allows it so that if we added a tag to the xml file for the graph boundary, we could implement the boundary for the simulation based on whatever is contained in this tag. This is because there is an abstract cell class, that contains methods based on the type of graph boundary in order to find the neighbors of the cell. These are a few of the features that we decided to make easy to implement.


## High-level Design

#### Core Classes
The design of the project starts with the configuration. This is done by the XML parser, which reads the XML files that contain the information needed to create the simulation objects. The information read from the parser is then stored in the parameters hashmap, and used to create the simulations in the Main class. The way the simulation part is designed is there is an abstract Simulation class, and various types of simulations extend this abstract class. The abstract class contains various methods, constructors, and instance variables that are used by all the simulation sub-classes, such as checking the neighbors (method for both 4 neighbors and 8 neighbors) of the cells that are used to represent various states based on the simulation. The data structure used to hold all the cells for each simulation was a 2D array, and each subclass implemented a createGrid and setCell method that created the 2D array and then set each individual cell based on the desired state. In order to update the state of the grid, a temporary, duplicate grid is created, and then the updated cell states are placed in this grid. Once all the updated cell states have been placed in this grid, the actual grid is updated to match this. The visualization of the grid is handled by the Visualizer class. This class takes in the simulation that is supposed to be displayed, and creates rectangle objects to represent each cell in the 2D array that contains the states of the cells in the simulation. It then uses the instance variable Colormap hashmap which has the cell state as keys and the color associated with it as values, and based on the state of the cell, the visualizer makes each rectangle its correct color. This method (colorGrid) is called repeatedly in the animation loop along with the updateGrid method, so that as the simulation goes along, the display updates as well. Finally, the Main class ties everything together. It contains the start method, which sets up the stage and the initial scene, and also creates the animation loop that, as described above, updates the simulation and the displayed grid. In addition, the Main class creates the rest of the UI, such as the various buttons, the graph, etc.  


## Assumptions that Affect the Design

#### Features Affected by Assumptions
In order to simplify our projectâ€™s design, some decisions were made. Firstly, we decided to create an abstract simulation class because we knew we had to implement at least 5 simulations, and possibly more based on the complete implementation. So, we knew that making an abstract simulation class would benefit us and lead to better design in the long run as all the simulations contained many similar features (the only thing that made the simulations distinctive were the individual simulation rules and cell states), and so this choice greatly simplified our design. Also, we created an abstract cell class, which allowed us to change the boundary of the simulation for every type of cell  (some of the simulations use a corresponding cell class, which are subclasses of this abstract cell class). This is a choice we made midway through the project, after seeing what the complete implementation required and the new simulations that had to be implemented. In addition, we formatted our XML files and designed our XML reader in a manner that allowed us to easily add various features to the project without having to worry about how the XML reader would handle it. This is because the XML reader checks only for tags for parameters and not nested tags, so it would be very simple to add another feature to the project (such as grid boundaries) by implementing a tag in the XML that allowed the user to load a simulation that contained this feature.

## New Features HowTo


#### Other Features not yet Done
To add new simulations to our project, first you have to create a simulation class that is a subclass of the Simulation class. Then, you would implement the logic of the simulation, using the neighbor methods in the Simulation super class. After this, you would implement a setup method in the Main class (following the structure of the other setup methods, as everything is the same other than the parameters), create the XML file for the simulation using the parameters as the tag names, and add this filename to the if tree that is in the simButtonSetup method in the Main class. This would implement a new simulation. In order to implement toroidal grid boundaries, you would first add it as a tag to the XML in order to choose whether you want toroidal or regular boundaries. You would then add this tag to the arraylist containing all the required parameters in the xml_parser class. Based on the value passed on, you would then call the corresponding version of updateCell in the Cell class in order to check for neighbors based on the grid boundaries (these methods have already been implemented, but tags and the ability for the user to choose this have not). Finally, in order to have hexagonal cells, you would call createHexGrid instead of createRecGrid in the initialize method in the Visualizer class, and this will make all the cells hexagons rather than rectangles.
