## Introduction
We need to create a general Cellular automata program that can run any of the five CA programs given to us. The primary architecture
of the design is broken up into three parts: simulation, configuration, visualization. Simulation should be open since we need it 
to work with different types of rules. The simulation is where the code needs to be the most flexible. Configuration should be closed 
since its operation is the same everytime. Visualization needs to be closed because it will be the same everytime.
