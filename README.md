### Primary Roles

Rodrigo: I handled completing most of the simulations. I created an abstract Cell class to make Predator Prey, Rock Paper Scissors, and Sugar Cells more efficient without having to carry over all of the same functions. The cell class also implemented finite and torroidal boundaries neighbor methods that allow any simulation that uses an inherited cell class to switch whenever needed. Setting up the config.properties file and its necessary methods to update the contents were also handled by me. Lastly, 

Vineet: Graphs, UI, ErrorChecking,
